# PRisma - AI-Powered Pull Request Reviewer

PRisma is an advanced AI system designed to redefine the pull request review process. It understands code structure, context, and style guides, delivering high-quality, contextual feedback within seconds.

## Features

- **Automated Code Review**: Analyzes pull requests for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and best practices
- **Contextual Feedback**: Provides specific, actionable comments on your code
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub's pull request workflow
- **Powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro**: Leverages Google's advanced AI model for deep code understanding

## How It Works

1. **PR Ingestion**: Activated by GitHub webhook upon pull_request events
2. **Data Retrieval**: Gathers diff and metadata via GitHub API
3. **AI Analysis**: Transmits diff and PR data to Gemini AI with a specialized prompt
4. **Feedback Delivery**: Analyzes AI output and posts inline comments to GitHub
